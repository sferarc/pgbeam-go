## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 06f9609: feat(cli): first-run golden path. New public `GET /v1/organizations` lists the organizations visible to the caller's credential (an org-scoped `pbo_` key sees exactly its org, a user credential sees memberships with roles). `pgbeam auth login` now verifies the key against the API before storing it (a rejected key fails the login and stores nothing) and resolves the organization automatically, auto-selecting a single org and prompting a pick among several. `orgs list` shows live organizations with the active one marked (falling back to saved profiles offline) and `orgs switch` with no argument lists and picks interactively. `auth status`/`whoami` verify the credential live when online and print the masked key, method, email, and org, degrading gracefully offline; `whoami --help` now shows its own name. Top-level `pgbeam link` and `pgbeam unlink` aliases are registered so every hint that references them works, and the project link is discovered by walking ancestor directories like git. `policies create` gains the write-safety flags `update` already had (`--write-mode`, `--approval-mode`, `--approval-timeout-seconds`, `--approval-auto-max-rows`, `--migration-safety`, `--table-allowlist`, `--table-denylist`). The "No organization set" error now names the exact dashboard location to copy an org ID, the `mcp --help` example shows the real `.mcp.json` stanza, and `agents mcp-config` explains all three ways to supply credentials when input is missing.

### Patch Changes

- 31cb990: feat(byoc): self-host enrollment hardening, optional `expires_at` on enrollment create/list and a rotate operation that mints a new `pbh_` token once and atomically invalidates the old one

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d70bf02: Publish and document the Go SDK (`go.pgbeam.com/sdk`). The release pipeline now tags the public mirror at `v{version}` on a sentinel bump so `go get go.pgbeam.com/sdk@vX.Y.Z` resolves through the Go module proxy, and the docs now ship a full quickstart plus examples across the agent-gateway surface (agent credentials, policy profiles, approvals, webhooks, audit logs). Merging this changeset's release PR cuts the first tagged SDK version.
